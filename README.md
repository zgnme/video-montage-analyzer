## 🛠️ Usage

### **Quick Start**

Get up and running with OpenSceneSense in just a few lines of code. Analyze your first video and unlock rich insights effortlessly.

```python
import logging
from openscenesense import ModelConfig, AnalysisPrompts, VideoAnalyzer, DynamicFrameSelector

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Defaults use `gpt-4o` (vision), `gpt-4o-mini` (text), and `whisper-1` (audio for segment-rich transcripts).
# Override below if you want different models.
# Set up custom models and prompts
custom_models = ModelConfig(
    vision_model="gpt-4o",           # Vision-capable model
    text_model="gpt-4o-mini",        # Chat completion model
    audio_model="whisper-1"          # Whisper model for audio transcription
)

custom_prompts = AnalysisPrompts(
    frame_analysis="Analyze this frame focusing on visible elements, actions, and their relationship with any audio.",
    detailed_summary="""Create a cohesive narrative that integrates both visual and audio elements into a single summary. 
                        Duration: {duration:.1f} seconds\nTimeline:\n{timeline}\nAudio Transcript:\n{transcript}""",
    brief_summary="""Provide a concise, easy-to-read summary combining the main visual and audio elements.
                     Duration: {duration:.1f} seconds\nTimeline:\n{timeline}\nTranscript:\n{transcript}"""

    log_level=logging.INFO
)

# Analyze the video
video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
results = analyzer.analyze_video(video_path)

# Print the results
print("\nBrief Summary:")
print(results['brief_summary'])

print("\nDetailed Summary:")
print(results['summary'])

print("\nVideo Timeline:")
print(results['timeline'])

print("\nMetadata:")
for key, value in results['metadata'].items():

## 🎯 The Power of Prompts in OpenSceneSense

The quality and specificity of prompts play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the analysis OpenSceneSense provides. Thoughtfully crafted prompts can help guide the models to focus on the most important aspects of each frame, audio element, and overall video context, resulting in more accurate, relevant, and insightful outputs. OpenSceneSense allows you to define custom prompts for different types of analyses, giving you unparalleled control over the results.

### **Why Prompts Matter**

- **Directing Focus**: Prompts help guide the model’s attention to specific elements, such as actions, emotions, or interactions within the video.
- **Creating Coherent Summaries**: Well-defined prompts ensure that summaries are cohesive and natural, integrating both visual and audio information seamlessly.
- **Contextualizing with Metadata**: By including tags like `{timeline}`, `{duration}`, and `{transcript}`, prompts can encourage the model to generate outputs that are contextually aware, helping users understand the full scope of the video’s content.

### **Example Prompts for Enhanced Analysis**

Here are some example prompts to inspire you and help you maximize the capabilities of OpenSceneSense:

1. **Frame-Level Analysis Prompt**  
   ```plaintext
   "Analyze this frame with a focus on visible objects, their movements, and any emotions they convey. Consider the context of prior and subsequent frames for continuity."
   ```
   *Use this prompt to capture detailed visual elements and their implications.*

2. **Detailed Summary Prompt**  
   ```plaintext
   "*DO NOT SEPARATE AUDIO AND VIDEO SPECIFICALLY* Create a cohesive narrative that combines visual and audio elements naturally. Use context from the {duration:.1f}-second video with reference to the timeline:\n{timeline}\n\nAudio Transcript:\n{transcript}."
   ```
   *This prompt encourages the model to generate a unified story that reflects both the audio and visual content without separation.*

3. **Brief Summary Prompt**  
   ```plaintext
   "Provide a concise summary that combines key visual and audio elements. Base your answer on the {duration:.1f}-second video, using insights from the timeline:\n{timeline}\n\n{transcript}. This should be easy to read and provide the complete context."
   ```
   *Ideal for quickly understanding the main points of the video.*

4. **Emotion and Tone Analysis Prompt**  
   ```plaintext
   "Analyze the visual and audio tone of this video, noting any emotional shifts or significant interactions. Reference the timeline:\n{timeline} and audio transcript:\n{transcript} for a nuanced interpretation."
   ```
   *This prompt works well for assessing emotional tone or sentiment, especially in videos with spoken dialogue or expressive visuals.*

### **Using `{timeline}`, `{duration}`, and `{transcript}` Tags**

Including these tags in your prompts helps provide essential context to the models, resulting in richer, more accurate analyses:

- **`{timeline}`**: This tag allows the model to refer to specific points within the video, giving it the ability to track the progression of events and identify key moments.
- **`{duration}`**: By knowing the total duration, the model can gauge the significance of each scene and avoid overemphasizing minor moments.
- **`{transcript}`**: The audio transcript tag helps the model integrate spoken content into its interpretation, ensuring that the summary and analysis reflect both visual and audio insights.

### **Best Practices for Crafting Prompts**

- **Be Specific and Clear**: A focused prompt yields focused results. Specify whether the model should analyze actions, emotions, or the relationship between visuals and audio.
- **Use Descriptive Language**: The more descriptive your prompt, the better the model can interpret and analyze the content.
- **Integrate Tags for Full Context**: Use `{timeline}`, `{duration}`, and `{transcript}` in your prompts to enhance the model’s awareness of the video’s structure and narrative flow.

### **How Prompts and Tags Elevate OpenSceneSense**

By leveraging powerful prompts and contextual tags, OpenSceneSense can provide insights that feel human-like in their depth and coherence. These tailored prompts allow the model to interpret complex video content in a way that is both holistic and precise, setting OpenSceneSense apart as a tool for serious video analysis and understanding.

With prompt-driven analysis, OpenSceneSense can become your intelligent partner in interpreting video content, whether for content moderation, dataset creation, or building interactive applications that respond to visual and audio cues naturally.

For a comprehensive list of innovative video analysis prompts, refer to the [Prompt Examples](Docs/prompts.md).
Note: By default, OpenSceneSense uses OpenAI's modern Responses API when available and
falls back to Chat Completions automatically for compatibility (including OpenRouter).
